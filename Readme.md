# Nmap Installation Guide for Windows

This repository provides a guide to install `nmap`, a network scanning tool, on Windows using PowerShell.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell with administrative rights
- Internet connection

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Nmap Installer

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
   - Right-click on the PowerShell icon.
   - Select "Run as administrator".

2. **Download the Installer**:
   - Execute the command below in PowerShell to download the Nmap installer. 
   - Replace `URL_TO_NMAP_INSTALLER` with the download URL from the [official Nmap website](https://nmap.org/download.html).

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri URL_TO_NMAP_INSTALLER -OutFile "nmap-setup.exe"
    ```

    For example:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.91-setup.exe" -OutFile "nmap-setup.exe"
    ```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

- Run the downloaded installer using the command:

  ```powershell
  Start-Process -FilePath ".\nmap-setup.exe"
### Step 3: Follow the Installation Prompts

#### Install Nmap:
- Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup wizard.
- Choose the components to install and the installation directory.

#### Complete the Setup:
- Finish the installation process by following the prompts.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

- Confirm Nmap installation by opening a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window and running:
  ```powershell
  nmap -v
This should display the Nmap version, indicating successful installation.
## Running the PowerShell Script

To run the PowerShell script, follow these steps:

### Open PowerShell:
- Open PowerShell on your Windows system.

### Copy the PowerShell Script:
- Copy the following PowerShell script into a file, for example, `Run-Nmap.ps1`.

### Run the Script:
- Navigate to the directory containing the script in PowerShell.
- Execute the script:

    ```powershell
    .\Run-Nmap.ps1
### Notes
- Always download Nmap from its official website to ensure security and get the latest version.
- The download URL may vary with different Nmap versions; refer to the official website for the most recent link.
- Running PowerShell as an administrator is necessary for installing software.
- Nmap's installation includes WinPcap/Npcap, essential for network packet capture. Ensure these components are installed with Nmap.
